#Smart Communication System for Disabled Individuals
An assistive device designed to help differently-abled students communicate seamlessly. The system enables:

* Speech to Sign Language – Converts spoken words into sign gestures.
* Speech to Braille – Translates speech into Braille output.
* Sign Recognition – Detects and converts sign language into readable text.
* Image-to-Text – Extracts and reads text from images.

This project aims to bridge communication gaps and promote inclusivity through AI, image processing, and assistive technology.
